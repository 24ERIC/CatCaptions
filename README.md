# CatCaptions

Winner - Best o**ut of the whisker box + MLH Fellowship Fastrack** 😉

It is my great honour to announce Our team finished the project “CatCaptions” during WhiskerHacks 2023 from Feb.24-26 2023. The project is an incredibly powerful AI backend that generates context right from the picture and NLP model to use the context to generate captions.

## 💡Inspiration

One of our members runs a fishkeeping Instagram account with weekly 
posts, but coming up with a witty, creative caption becomes a challenge 
after a while with ideas getting used up. This is where an AI-powered 
app like CatCaptions comes in handy, since it generates a virtually 
inexhaustible supply of funny texts that help entertain followers.

## 🧬What it does

Simply pick an image from your camera roll, wait, and voila! 5 
beautiful, autogenerated captions just waiting to be used. Choose one, 
copy to your clipboard or get it sent right to you via text message and 
post!

On a more technical note, the image is sent to an API, where it is 
processed by Cohere and ChatGPT. The models then give it a few possible 
captions, and these are sent back to the user by text using Twilio.

## 👨‍💻How we built it

We used React Native for the frontend and an API that accesses Cohere and ChatGPT for the backend.

## 🧠Challenges we ran into

- Expo Go just didn't work
- We tried to use React Native templates in our interface, but this proved harder than making a UI in React.
- One of our members had an elementary knowledge of vanilla JS and knew nothing about
frameworks, so struggled to understand what they were doing

## 😎Accomplishments that we're proud of

We made it, the amazing React Native App we are pround of!
